## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 🚀 Immersive Effects
* **Speed Lines:** Feel the rush! Anime-style speed lines appear at the edges of your screen when you move fast (e.g., Elytra flight). Fully customizable in color, density, and speed threshold.

### 🖥️ HUD Improvements
* **Pickup Notifier:** Gone are the days of checking your inventory to see what you picked up. An elegant, RPG-style popup shows items and XP gained directly on your HUD. Supports rarity colors and custom positioning.
* **Elytra Pitch Helper:** Master your flight. Visual guide lines appear while gliding to help you maintain the perfect angle (40° / -40°) for maximum distance.
* **Status Effect Bars:** Displays a duration bar directly under the potion icons in your inventory and HUD, so you know exactly when your buffs will run out.

### 🤝 Multiplayer & Social
* **Chat Heads:** See who you are talking to! Renders the player's skin face next to their messages in the chat.
* **Player Locator:** A compass-like bar at the top of the screen shows the direction of other players relative to you.

### ℹ️ Informative Tooltips
* **Map Tooltips:** Hover over a filled map item to see the dimension and coordinates of the mapped area.
* **Held Item Tooltips:** Get detailed info about the item in your hand (Durability, Enchantments) without opening your inventory.
